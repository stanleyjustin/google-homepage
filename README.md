This is to re-create the Google.com homepage.
It is a non-functioning version with no search. 
All links are placeholders that point to "#".
The goal is to practice positioning elements with HTML and CSS.
The secondary goal of the project is to practice using dev tools with Chrome/Firefox to imitate te look of specific elements to look like those on Google.com.
